## üí° Development Philosophy

TabComp follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. Each component is designed to be independent and communicates through well-defined APIs, making it easy to maintain, test, and extend.

## ‚ú® Acknowledgments

This project was developed with the assistance of Claude, an AI assistant by Anthropic. The AI helped with architectural design, code structure, and documentation, demonstrating the potential of human-AI collaboration in open-source development.

## Performance Benchmarks

The following benchmarks are enforced through automated testing:

- File Loading: < 3 seconds for 100MB files
- Memory Usage: < 2x file size during processing
- Comparison Speed: > 100,000 rows/second
- UI Responsiveness: < 100ms for user interactions

Performance monitoring is automated through GitHub Actions:

```bash
# Run performance tests
pytest tests/performance/
```

## Error Handling

TabComp implements a comprehensive error handling system:

1. User-Facing Errors

   - Clear error messages with suggested actions
   - Non-technical descriptions for common issues
   - Progress indicators for long operations

2. Developer-Facing Errors
   - Detailed stack traces in logs
   - Error codes for automated handling
   - Context information for debugging

## Dependencies

Required Python packages (latest stable versions):

- pandas
- openpyxl
- tkinter
- xlsxwriter
- pytest (for testing)

## Automated Testing

Continuous Integration ensures compatibility with latest dependency versions:

```bash
# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=tabcomp tests/
```
